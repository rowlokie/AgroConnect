          Contract farming provides farmers with a stable income by securing a
          market and setting prices in advance. This reduces the financial risks
          associated with unpredictable market fluctuations. Farmers also
          benefit from support like seeds and technical guidance, which helps
          lower production costs. By minimizing uncertainties, contract farming
          makes agriculture more sustainable. Overall, it offers a reliable way
          for farmers to earn and thrive.
