                <p id="page3-Text" className="page3-info">Secure payment systems in contract farming significantly reduce the risk of scams for both farmers and merchants by ensuring that transactions are transparent and protected. Payments are guaranteed, which builds trust between parties and encourages fair trade. It also simplifies record-keeping, making it easier to track and verify transactions. By safeguarding financial exchanges, secure payments promote a more reliable and efficient contract farming process, ensuring that both parties meet their obligations without worry.</p>
